When I proposed this project, I did so with the mindset of making a research project, rather than a tool or website. I ended up pivoting relatively hard when I got the feedback for my proposal. I still made all the tools for analyzing the stats I wanted to, but rather than doing the analysis myself, I instead focused on making a website for using them. There's thus no writeup of any findings about the different blaseball statistics do.

I also ended up cutting a lot of my plans with Vibes to focus on Fate instead, partially due to time constraints and partially due to graphing difficulties. I couldn't figure out how I would go about analyzing and graphing comparisons involving a constantly changing number, so I decided to narrow my focus to what I actually could complete.
